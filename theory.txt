Javascript (makes webpage dynamic)
---------------
Javascript is a programming language allows us to implement complex features on webpages.

HTML - is the markup language that we use to structure and five meaning to our webcontent
CSS - is a language of style rules that we used to apply styling to our HTML content
Javascript - is a scripting language that enables us to create dynamically updating the content

Syntax parser
----------------
A program that reads our code and determines what exactly it does and if its grammer is valid

inbuilt - engines
------------------
Chrome has inbuilt V8 browser to compile Javascript code
Spidermonkey for mozilla
javascriptcore is Apple's engine for safari
chakra for IE

Lexical environment
------------------
Where something sits physically in the code we write

execution content
-------------------
A wrapper to help manage the code that is running

Name-value pair
------------------
a name which maps to a unique values

user: "Srujana"

Object
---------
A collection of name value pairs

Execution context (global)
---------------------------
global Object
this (variable)

this - window (the browser window)
Global Object - window

Global - which is not inside the function
local - means inside the function

//Global
var a = "Hello world"

function b(){ 
//local
}

Hoisting 
---------
when you declare variables and functions in javascript, the engine sets up 
memory space for variables and functions


if it is a variable it will keep that variable in memory and assign a value called undefined.
if it is a function it will copy entire function and keeps it in memory.

Javascript is single threaded and synchronous execution -  takes one thing at a time

Single threaded
---------------------
One at a time

Synchronous -- one at a time
ASynchronous -- multiple things at a time


Synchronous -- one at a time
-------------------
1. get the data from database
2. get the file from network location
3. update the file with data from database

ASynchronous
--------------------
1. get the data from database
1. get the file from network location
2. update the file with data from database

Scope --  where a variable is available in your code

dynamic typing
--------------
we don't have to tell the engine what types of data a variable holds
it figures out while your code is running. 

Static typing
----------------
We need to explicitly mention that data type to engine

Primitive types
----------------
A type of data that represents a single value.

1. number -- all number types like int , float etc.,
2. string -- ( we can use both '' and "" )
3. boolean -- true or false
4. undefined -- represents lack of existence ( never set a variable to undefined)
5. null -- represents lack of existence( we can set null to a variable)
6. symbol(from Javascript6) -- Used in ES6

functions
-------------
1. Named function or regular functions
2. Anonymous function
3. Immediately invoked functions


Objects
--------
collection of name value pairs

JSON
-----
Javascript object notation - inspired by Object literal notation.

properties have to wrapped in quotes for JSON
anything valid in JSON is valid in object literal

common usage of JSON is to exchange data to/from web servers
when sending data to a webserver that data has to be string.

JSON Stringify -- Converts a JSON object to string
        Converts a javascript value to be serialized 
JSON parse -- Converts a string to JSON object.
        deserialises a JSON representation to javascript 
Arrays
---------
An Array is an object hat can store a collection of items

Useful when you want to store large amount of data


Callback functions
------------------
Functions being passed as a parameter to another parameter


Call, bind, apply
--------------------
bind - creates a copy of that function and sets 'this' keyword.

call - sets 'this' keyword and executes the function Immediately and it doesnt 
        create a new copy of the functions

apply -- it is similar to call, the difference is that apply methods accepts 
        an array of arguments instead of comma separate values

The call, bind, apply methods can be used to set 'this' keyword
independant of how functions is called.
